# eBPF Traffic Meter

A per-user network traffic monitoring tool using eBPF. Captures all IPv4 and IPv6 network traffic and logs it to per-user files with direction, bytes, and IP addresses.

## Requirements

- Linux kernel 5.8+ (for ring buffer support)
- clang (for BPF compilation)
- libbpf, libelf, libz development headers
- Root privileges (for loading eBPF programs)

### Fedora/RHEL

```bash
sudo dnf install clang libbpf-devel elfutils-libelf-devel zlib-devel
```

### Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt install clang libbpf-dev libelf-dev zlib1g-dev
```

## Building

```bash
make clean && make
```

This produces:
- `traffic_meter.bpf.o` - eBPF program object
- `traffic_meter_user` - User-space loader
- `ipmask_tool` - generates bitmasks of untracked networks in network byte order, see [below](#ipfilter)

## Usage

```bash
sudo ./traffic_meter_user [cgroup_path] [nic_id]
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `cgroup_path` | `/sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice` | Cgroup to attach to (falls back to `/sys/fs/cgroup`) |
| `nic_id` | `unknown` | Identifier for log filenames |

### Examples

```bash
# Default cgroup, specify NIC for filename
sudo ./traffic_meter_user "" eno1

# Specific cgroup path
sudo ./traffic_meter_user /sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/user-1000.slice eth0

# Monitor all traffic (root cgroup)
sudo ./traffic_meter_user /sys/fs/cgroup wlan0
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

## Output

Log files are written to `/tmp/traffic_user_<nic_id>_<uid>.log` in CSV format:

```
direction,bytes,src_ip,dst_ip,timestamp,total_in,total_out
```

### Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `direction` | `in` (received) or `out` (sent) |
| `bytes` | Packet size in bytes |
| `src_ip` | Source IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) |
| `dst_ip` | Destination IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) |
| `timestamp` | Unix timestamp with nanosecond precision (seconds.nanoseconds) |
| `total_in` | Cumulative bytes received so far for this UID |
| `total_out` | Cumulative bytes sent so far for this UID |

### Example Output

```csv
out,52,192.168.1.100,8.8.8.8,1732985432.123456789,0,52
in,84,8.8.8.8,192.168.1.100,1732985432.234567890,84,52

## Untracked IP Filtering 

The eBPF program includes a static list of IPv4 and IPv6 network masks that are **ignored** during monitoring. 

These masks are defined in the file `untracked_masks.h` included by`traffic_meter.bpf.c` as `untracked_ipv4` and `untracked_ipv6` arrays. 

For each packet the program checks whether the source **and** destination address matches any of the configured networks.
If a match is found, the event is discarded with `bpf_ringbuf_discard()` and the packet is allowed to continue without being logged.

* **IPv4** – Each entry stores a network address and a netmask in network byte order. Example entries include `10.0.0.0/8` and `192.168.1.0/24`.
* **IPv6** – Each entry stores a 16‑byte network prefix and a prefix length. The helper function `ipv6_is_untracked()` performs a byte‑wise comparison respecting the prefix length.

To modify the ignored networks, edit the static arrays in `untracked_masks.h` and rebuild the project (`make clean && make`). 
This allows you to tailor the monitoring to exclude internal or otherwise irrelevant traffic.

Content of file `untracked_masks.h`

```c
static const struct ipv4_mask untracked_ipv4[] = {
  { __builtin_bswap32(0x0a000000), __builtin_bswap32(0xff000000) }, // 10.0.0.0/8
  { __builtin_bswap32(0xc0a80100), __builtin_bswap32(0xffffff00) }, // 192.168.1.0/24
};

static const struct ipv6_mask untracked_ipv6[] = {
    { { 0x20, 0x01, 0x0d, 0xb8, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 }, 32 },
    { { 0x20, 0x01, 0x0d, 0xb8, 0xab, 0xcd, 0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78, 0x9a, 0xbc, 0xde, 0xf0, 0x00, 0x00 }, 112 },
};
```

Use the included `ipmask_tool` to generate the the `untracked_masks.h` file from a list of IP
addresses stored in a file using `*` as the wildcard; e.g.:

`ip_list.txt`:
```
10.0.*.*
192.168.1.*
2001:db8::*
2001:db8:abcd:1234:5678:9abc:def0:*
```

**Usage**

```sh
./ipmask_tool ip_list.txt > untracked_masks.h
```

The tool is useful for maintaining the untracked networks without manually calculating bitmasks.

Note that, because loops are forbidden in eBPF kernels, a `#pragma unroll` directive is used to unroll the loop
and the array length is a static constant. The maximum number of iterations to be considered for
a full unrolling varies with the compiler and the compiler version and in some cases can be dynamic
based on the analysis the compiler does of the code.


## Architecture

1. **eBPF Program** (`traffic_meter.bpf.c`):
   - Attaches to `cgroup_skb/egress` and `cgroup_skb/ingress` hooks for both IPv4 and IPv6
   - Uses `bpf_get_socket_uid()` to identify the socket owner (UID)
   - Extracts source/destination IPs from IP headers
   - Sends events to user space via separate ring buffers for IPv4 and IPv6

2. **User-Space Loader** (`traffic_meter_user.c`):
   - Loads and attaches the eBPF programs (4 total: ingress/egress for IPv4 and IPv6)
   - Polls both ring buffers for events
   - Tracks cumulative bytes per UID for in/out directions
   - Passes events to pluggable output backend
   - Default backend writes CSV to per-user log files


The output system uses a pluggable backend interface:

```c
struct output_backend {
    int (*init)(void *config);
    int (*write)(const struct traffic_record *rec);
    void (*close)(void);
};
```

To add new output targets (syslog, network socket, database, etc.), implement this interface and set `g_backend` to your implementation.
